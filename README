YankURL is a server that generates a pair of bookmarklets for users.  The "Copy" bookmarklet copies the current website and saves it to the user's clipboard.  The "Paste" bookmarklet redirects the current page to the last URL that was copied on to the clipboard.

Running the Server:

The server is a ruby bundle. Get the bundler and then use it to get everything else:
        sudo gem install bundler
        sudo bundle install

We're now using Ruby 1.9.2 which we manage with rvm:
        rvm 1.9.2

Launch the server with this bundle command:
        bundle exec rackup -s thin -p 9989
